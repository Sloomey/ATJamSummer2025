Penelope: Hey, where did your family go for summer vacation?
Penelope: We went to the Maldives. It was OK but I wanted to go to the Seychelles. Daddy never gets me what I want!
    *[That's horrible!]
    Penelope: I know! Like last year, I asked for a pony and he gave me a horse. A horse! ->END
    *[You sound like a spoiled brat]
    Penelope: Excuse me? My daddy says I'm perfect so I deserve everything in the world. 
    Penelope: I'm done talking to you now. ->END
    *[Bye] ->END
